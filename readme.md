## System Overview

The LLM-Based Multi-Agent Reasoning System is designed to intelligently determine job changes and Ideal Customer Profile (ICP) matching through autonomous agent collaboration. Unlike rule-based systems, this implementation leverages Large Language Models for contextual reasoning, inference, and decision-making.

- **Contextual Reasoning**: LLMs understand business nuances, company relationships, and career progression
- **Autonomous Collaboration**: Agents call each other based on intelligent decision-making
- **Explainable AI**: Every decision comes with reasoning and confidence scores
- **Fault Tolerance**: Graceful handling of incomplete, conflicting, or noisy data

### Core Capabilities

1. **Job Change Detection**
   - Understands company mergers, acquisitions, and rebranding
   - Recognizes subsidiary relationships and corporate restructuring
   - Differentiates between role changes and company transformations

2. **ICP Matching**
   - Contextual understanding of job titles and seniority levels
   - Industry-aware role interpretation
   - Career progression analysis

3. **Business Intelligence**
   - Email pattern generation and validation
   - Company domain analysis
   - Professional profile synthesis

## Message Flow

### Message Bus Architecture

The system uses an event-driven message bus for agent communication:

```mermaid
graph TB
    subgraph "Message Bus Components"
        Router[Message Router]
        Queue[Message Queue]
        Logger[Message Logger]
        Validator[Message Validator]
    end
    
    subgraph "Agents"
        A1[Agent 1] 
        A2[Agent 2]
        A3[Agent 3]
        AN[Agent N]
    end
    
    A1 --> Router
    A2 --> Router
    A3 --> Router
    AN --> Router
    
    Router --> Queue
    Queue --> Validator
    Validator --> Logger
    
    Router --> A1
    Router --> A2
    Router --> A3
    Router --> AN
```

### Message Types

1. **Request Messages**
   - Agent-to-agent task requests
   - Data inquiry messages
   - Analysis requests

2. **Response Messages**

   - Analysis results

3. **Control Messages**
   - System status updates
   - Error notifications
   - Workflow coordination

### Message Structure

```python
@dataclass
class AgentMessage:
    sender: AgentType
    recipient: AgentType
    content: Dict[str, Any]
    message_type: str
    timestamp: datetime
    correlation_id: str
    priority: int
```

## Implementation Details

### LLM Integration

**Model Selection**:
- **Primary**: GPT-4 for complex reasoning tasks
- **Secondary**: GPT-3.5-turbo for simple classification tasks
- **Fallback**: Claude-3 for redundancy and comparison

**Prompt Engineering Strategy**:

1. **System Prompts**: Define agent role and capabilities
2. **Context Injection**: Provide relevant background information
3. **Few-shot Examples**: Include example inputs/outputs for consistency
4. **Output Formatting**: Specify structured JSON responses
5. **Confidence Calibration**: Request confidence scores with explanations

**Example Prompt Template**:
```python
system_prompt = f"""
You are a {agent_role} agent with the following capabilities:
{capabilities_list}

Your task is to {specific_task}.

Always respond in JSON format with the following structure:
{expected_output_schema}

Consider these factors in your analysis:
{analysis_factors}
"""
```

### Error Handling & Resilience

**LLM Response Handling**:
- JSON parsing with fallback strategies
- Response validation against expected schemas
- Retry logic for API failures
- Graceful degradation for partial failures

**Agent Failure Recovery**:
- Circuit breaker pattern for failing agents
- Fallback agent implementations
- Partial result acceptance with lower confidence

**Data Quality Issues**:
- Input validation and sanitization
- Missing data imputation strategies
- Conflicting information resolution
- Noise filtering and outlier detection

### Confidence Scoring

**Multi-Level Confidence**:
1. **Agent-Level**: Individual agent confidence in their analysis
2. **Evidence-Level**: Strength of supporting evidence
3. **System-Level**: Overall confidence in final decision

**Confidence Calculation**:
```python
def calculate_system_confidence(agent_results):
    weighted_sum = 0
    total_weight = 0
    
    for agent, result in agent_results.items():
        weight = AGENT_WEIGHTS[agent]
        confidence = result.get('confidence', 0.5)
        
        weighted_sum += weight * confidence
        total_weight += weight
    
    return weighted_sum / total_weight if total_weight > 0 else 0.5
```
